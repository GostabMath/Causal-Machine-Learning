### Objective

The goal of this practice is to help students go over some slide materials and use programming languages to interpret what we have learned in the first 5 classes. Please follow the instructions neatly and complete your work; the work won't be graded but that may be conducive to your project as I will walk you through each method deeper.

Welcome to email me via gostab.jen@nyu.edu with any questions.

### Estimate Time Cost

If you expect to fully understand this materials(application coding, executions and evaluation as well as advanced properties), the time estimate in total will exceed 8 hours. As for just basic application of these discussed methods, you may complete it within 2 hours.

### Clarification about exams

This practice is not for your exam!! That means if you want to prepare for your exam, please note lecture notes are the only fair game of it. Concepts and practice won't be tested in your exam.
