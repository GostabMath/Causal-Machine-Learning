# Course Site: Needed Knowledge in Basic Statistics

>This site covers five courses I have taught/led/TA-ed during my regular academic semester from 2022 Spring to 2023 Fall. Currently, I do not regular teach these courses and focus my research and the only one course I will be teaching: DSUA-201. I would say thank you to everyone I have worked with before. I will upload those materials created solely by me, including slides, experiment code and short course notes.
